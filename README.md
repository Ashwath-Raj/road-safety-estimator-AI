# road-safety-estimator-AI
AI-powered estimator tool that automates material cost calculation for road safety interventions using IRC standards and real-time price data from CPWD and GeM.

This project, developed for the National Road Safety Hackathon 2025 (IIT Madras), focuses on automating material cost estimation for road safety interventions.
The AI model extracts keywords and specifications from intervention reports and IRC standards, fetches live rates from official sources (CPWD, GeM), and generates an itemized, explainable material-only cost report with source citations.
